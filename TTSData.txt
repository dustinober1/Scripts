Once upon a time, there was a small village nestled in a remote valley surrounded by towering mountains. The people of the village were simple folk who lived off the land and the animals that grazed in the nearby meadows. Among them was a young girl named Leila. She was kind-hearted and loved by everyone in the village.
Leila had always been fascinated by the mountains that surrounded the village. She would often spend hours gazing at them, wondering what lay beyond their peaks. One day, she decided to venture into the mountains to explore. She packed a small bag with some food and water and set off early in the morning.
As she climbed higher and higher, the air grew colder and the terrain more treacherous. But Leila was determined to reach the top of the mountain. After several hours of hiking, she finally reached the summit. The view was breathtaking. She could see for miles in every direction.
Suddenly, a gust of wind caught her off guard, and she stumbled backwards. She reached out to grab onto something, but there was nothing there. She felt herself falling, tumbling down the steep slope. She closed her eyes, bracing herself for the impact.
But when she opened her eyes, she found herself in a strange land. It was unlike anything she had ever seen before. The sky was a bright shade of pink, and the clouds were a deep shade of purple. The trees were tall and thin, with leaves that glowed in the sunlight. She was surrounded by strange animals that she had never seen before.
Leila was amazed by this new world. She wandered around for hours, exploring every nook and cranny. She met all sorts of creatures, from tiny insects to towering giants. Each one had a unique story to tell.
As night fell, Leila realized that she needed to find shelter. She stumbled upon a small cave and crawled inside. She was tired and hungry, but she had no food left. She curled up into a ball and fell asleep, hoping that she would wake up in her own world the next morning.
But when she woke up, she was still in the strange land. She decided to keep exploring, hoping that she would find a way back home. As she wandered around, she came across a group of creatures who were gathering around a small pond. They were all staring at something in the water.
Curious, Leila approached them and looked into the pond. She saw a reflection of herself, but it was distorted and twisted. She reached out to touch the water, and suddenly, she was pulled under.
When she surfaced, she was back in her own world, standing at the bottom of the mountain. She looked up and saw the summit, still visible in the distance. She smiled to herself, knowing that she had experienced something truly magical. From that day on, Leila knew that anything was possible if she just believed.
Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the foothills of the mountains, there was a young girl named Maya. She lived with her parents and her younger brother, and they ran a small bakery in the town square. Maya had always loved baking, and she spent most of her free time experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen
One day, Maya was approached by a woman she had never seen before. The woman was dressed in a long flowing robe, and her hair was adorned with colorful flowers. She introduced herself as a fairy and asked Maya if she would like to come with her to the fairy realm.
Maya was skeptical at first, but the fairy assured her that it would be an adventure of a lifetime. Maya hesitated for a moment, but her curiosity got the best of her, and she agreed to go with the fairy.
The fairy took Maya to a hidden portal in the woods. She instructed Maya to close her eyes and hold her breath as they entered the portal. When Maya opened her eyes, she found herself in a world she could never have imagined. The sky was a bright shade of blue, and the clouds were puffy and white. The grass was a vivid green, and the trees were tall and majestic. Maya had never seen anything like it before.
As they walked through the fairy realm, the fairy explained that the fairies needed Maya's help. The fairy queen had fallen ill, and no one knew how to cure her. The fairy queen was the heart of the fairy realm, and without her, the fairies would perish.
Maya was hesitant at first, but she couldn't bear to see the fairies suffer. She agreed to help in any way she could. The fairy led her to the fairy queen's castle, where Maya was introduced to the fairy queen's daughter, Princess Luna.
Princess Luna was a beautiful fairy with long flowing hair and delicate wings. She explained to Maya that the fairy queen had been poisoned by an evil fairy, and they needed to find a cure before it was too late. She asked Maya if she could help find the cure.
Maya was unsure of what to do, but she knew she had to try. Princess Luna gave her a small vial of the poison and instructed her to take it to the fairy healer. The fairy healer was an ancient fairy who had been around for centuries. She was said to have the power to heal any illness or injury.
Maya set off on her journey, determined to find the fairy healer. She traveled through the enchanted forest, over the rolling hills, and across the sparkling streams. She met all sorts of creatures along the way, from tiny pixies to giant trolls. But she kept her focus on her goal.
After several days of traveling, Maya finally reached the fairy healer's cottage. She knocked on the door, and a small old fairy answered. Maya explained her mission and showed her the vial of poison. The fairy healer examined the poison and confirmed that it was indeed a potent and deadly poison.
She explained to Maya that the only way to cure the fairy queen was to find a rare flower that grew deep in the forest. The flower was called the golden heart, and it was said to have the power to heal any illness or injury. The fairy healer gave Maya a map to the location of the golden heart and warned her of the dangers that lay ahead.
Maya set off on her journey once again, determined to find the golden heart. She followed the map through the dense forest, over rocky cliffs, and across the raging river. She encountered all sorts of obstacles along the way, from poisonous snakes to treacherous ravines. But she never gave up.
Finally, after several more days of traveling, Maya found the golden heart. It was a beautiful
Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Jack who lived in a small village on the edge of a dense forest. Jack was a curious boy who loved exploring the woods, but his mother had always warned him of the dangers that lurked within.
One day, while playing near the edge of the forest, Jack heard a strange noise coming from deep within the trees. It was a soft and melodic sound that he had never heard before. Jack was intrigued, and he couldn't resist the urge to investigate.
He ventured deeper into the forest, following the sound until he came across a small clearing. In the center of the clearing was a beautiful, shimmering pool of water. Jack had never seen anything like it before. He approached the pool, drawn by its beauty.
As he gazed into the water, he saw a figure emerging from the depths. It was a beautiful mermaid with long flowing hair and sparkling green eyes. She smiled at Jack and beckoned him to come closer.
Jack was hesitant at first, but he couldn't resist the mermaid's beauty. He stepped closer to the edge of the pool, and the mermaid reached out to him. Jack took her hand, and suddenly, he was pulled into the water.
As he submerged, Jack felt a sense of calm and peace wash over him. He felt weightless and free, surrounded by the mermaid's embrace. She took him on a journey through the underwater world, showing him all the wonders that lay beneath the surface.
They swam through fields of seaweed, past schools of brightly colored fish, and through coral reefs teeming with life. Jack was amazed by the beauty of the underwater world, and he felt as though he had found a new home.
But as the day began to fade, the mermaid knew it was time for Jack to return to the surface. She brought him back to the edge of the pool, and as he emerged from the water, he felt as though he had awoken from a dream.
Jack returned to his village, but he couldn't stop thinking about the mermaid and the underwater world. He knew he had to find a way to return to the pool and see her again.
Over the next few days, Jack searched the forest for the pool, but he couldn't find it. He was about to give up when he heard the sound of the mermaid's song once again.
He followed the sound until he came across a small stream. He followed the stream deeper into the forest until he finally reached the pool. The mermaid was waiting for him, and she smiled as he approached.
From that day on, Jack visited the mermaid every day, and she took him on new adventures beneath the surface of the water. He learned about the creatures of the sea and the magic that lay within the depths.
Years passed, and Jack grew old. He knew that he could no longer make the journey to the pool every day, but he knew that the mermaid would always be with him in his heart. He returned to the pool one last time to say goodbye to the mermaid.
As he approached the pool, he saw the mermaid waiting for him. She smiled, and he felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that he was ready to leave the world, knowing that he had experienced something truly magical.
And so, Jack passed away, but his spirit lived on in the memories he had made with the mermaid. The people of the village remembered him as a wise and adventurous man, who had discovered a world beyond their own.
Hello and welcome. As you probably know, deep learning has already transformed traditional internet businesses like web search and advertising. But deep learning is also enabling brand new products and businesses and ways of helping people to be created. Everything ranging from better healthcare, where deep learning is getting really good at reading X-ray images to delivering personalized education, to precision agriculture, to even self driving cars and many others. If you want to learn the tools of deep learning and be able to apply them to build these amazing things, I want to help you get there. When you finish the sequence of courses on Coursera, called the specialization, you will be able to put deep learning onto your resume with confidence. Over the next decade, I think all of us have an opportunity to build an amazing world, amazing society, that is AI-powered, and I hope that you will play a big role in the creation of this AI-powered society. So that, let's get started. I think that AI is the new electricity. Starting about 100 years ago, the electrification of our society transformed every major industry, everything ranging from transportation, manufacturing, to healthcare, to communications and many more. And I think that today, we see a surprisingly clear path for AI to bring about an equally big transformation. And of course, the part of AI that is rising rapidly and driving a lot of these developments, is deep learning. So today, deep learning is one of the most highly sought after skills in the technology world. And through this course, and a few courses after this one, I want to help you to gain and master those skills. So here is what you will learn in this sequence of courses also called a specialization on Coursera. In the first course, you will learn about the foundations of neural networks, you will learn about neural networks and deep learning. This video that you are watching is part of this first course, which last four weeks in total. And each of the five courses in the specialization will be about two to four weeks, with most of them actually shorter than four weeks. But in this first course, you will learn how to build a neural network, including a deep neural network, and how to train it on data. And at the end of this course, you will be able to build a deep neural network to recognize, guess what? Cats. For some reason, there is a cat meme running around in deep learning. And so, following tradition in this first course, we will build a cat recognizer. Then in the second course, you will learn about the practical aspects of deep learning. So you will learn, now that you have built a neurak network, how to actually get it to perform well. So you learn about hyperparameter tuning, regularization, how to diagnose bias, and variants, and advance optimization algorithms, like momentum, armrest, prop, and the ad authorization algorithm. Sometimes it seems like there is a lot of tuning, even some black magic in how you build a new network. So the second course, which is just three weeks, will demystify some of that black magic. In the third course, which is just two weeks, you will learn how to structure your machine learning project. It turns out that the strategy for building a machine learning system has changed in the era of deep learning. So for example, the way you split your data into train, development or dev, also called holdout cross-validation sets, and test sets, has changed in the era of deep learning. So what are the new best practices for doing that? And whether if your training set and your test come from different distributions, that is happening a lot more in the era of deep learning. So, how do you deal with that? And if you have heard of end-to-end deep learning, you will also learn more about that in this third course, and see when you should use it and maybe when you shouldn't. The material in this third course is relatively unique. I am going to share of you a lot of the hard-won lessons that I have learned, building and shipping quite a lot of deep learning products. As far as I know, this is largely material that is not taught in most universities that have deep learning courses. But I think it will really help you to get your deep learning systems to work well. In the next course, we will then talk about convolutional neural networks, often abbreviated CNNs. Convolutional networks, or convolutional neural networks, are often applied to images. So you will learn how to build these models in course four. Finally, in course five, you will learn sequence models and how to apply them to natural language processing and other problems. So sequence models includes models like recurrent neural networks, abbreviated RNNs, and LSTM models, stands for a long short term memory models. You will learn what these terms mean in course five and be able to apply them to natural language processing problems. So you will learn these models in course five and be able to apply them to sequence data. So for example, natural language is just a sequence of words, and you will also understand how these models can be applied to speech recognition, or to music generation, and other problems. So through these courses, you will learn the tools of deep learning, you will be able to apply them to build amazing things, and I hope many of you through this will also be able to advance your career. So with that, let's get started. Please go on to the next video where we will talk about deep learning applied to supervised learning.
There's been a lot of hype about neural networks. And perhaps some of that hype is justified, given how well they're working. But it turns out that so far, almost all the economic value created by neural networks has been through one type of machine learning, called supervised learning. Let's see what that means, and let's go over some examples. In supervised learning, you have some input x, and you want to learn a function mapping to some output y. So for example, just now we saw the housing price prediction application where you input some features of a home and try to output or estimate the price y. Here are some other examples that neural networks have been applied to very effectively. Possibly the single most lucrative application of deep learning today is online advertising, maybe not the most inspiring, but certainly very lucrative, in which, by inputting information about an ad to the website it's thinking of showing you, and some information about the user, neural networks have gotten very good at predicting whether or not you click on an ad. And by showing you and showing users the ads that you are most likely to click on, this has been an incredibly lucrative application of neural networks at multiple companies. Because the ability to show you ads that you're more likely to click on has a direct impact on the bottom line of some of the very large online advertising companies.
Computer vision has also made huge strides in the last several years, mostly due to deep learning. So you might input an image and want to output an index, say from 1 to 1,000 trying to tell you if this picture, it might be any one of, say a 1000 different images. So, you might us that for photo tagging. I think the recent progress in speech recognition has also been very exciting, where you can now input an audio clip to a neural network, and have it output a text transcript. Machine translation has also made huge strides thanks to deep learning where now you can have a neural network input an English sentence and directly output say, a Chinese sentence. And in autonomous driving, you might input an image, say a picture of what's in front of your car as well as some information from a radar, and based on that, maybe a neural network can be trained to tell you the position of the other cars on the road. So this becomes a key component in autonomous driving systems. So a lot of the value creation through neural networks has been through cleverly selecting what should be x and what should be y for your particular problem, and then fitting this supervised learning component into often a bigger system such as an autonomous vehicle. It turns out that slightly different types of neural networks are useful for different applications. For example, in the real estate application that we saw in the previous video, we use a universally standard neural network architecture, right? Maybe for real estate and online advertising might be a relatively standard neural network, like the one that we saw.
“Do they come with a card?” I solemnly asked the florist, a petite, tan woman with thick blonde hair cascading down her back. The kind of hair that has become popular for women half her age to have threaded and sewn onto the base of their skull. Even though we were in West Hollywood, the pulse of trend and glamour, the three untouched horizontal lines etched onto her forehead told me that her hair was hers and that she had only passed by the fancy salons lined up around the corner on Santa Monica Blvd, never to even wonder who was inside. I on the other hand, was a regular at one of those salons.
On the Saturday mornings that I was off, I would enter the beauty haven in my strategically-worn leather boots and ripped denim and discuss the Negative Love Cycle with my stylist, a chicly-thin, equal part stoner and girl’s girl. Last June, I sat under a dryer waiting for my conditioning treatment to set in and tried to eaves drop on Ellen Pompeo, the lead actress on Gray’s Anatomy. She softly spoke to her colorist, a gender-fluid man with highlighted cheekbones, a purposeful five o’clock shadow and two-hundred thousand Instagram followers. He in turn, pursed his glossy, plump lips and nodded in agreement as he transformed her ashy blonde hair into a sun-kissed Balayage masterpiece. That day, I leaned towards the both of them pretending to text, fully focusing all of my thoughts on to my ears, as if that could intensify my hearing. I tried as hard as I could to gather what they were saying while simultaneously questioning why I cared.  Since moving to LA for residency I had seen too many celebrities to count; Dr. Dre in a valet line, Cuba Gooding Jr at a piano bar, and I even shared a cigarette once outside of the W Hotel with Pink, but looking at Meredith Gray was like looking into a carnival fun mirror. Here was a woman who played a physician, where I was a woman who was sitting there having my hair done playing anything but.
There are the physicians that live and breathe medicine. The true scholars. The scientists that wake up on a Sunday morning, configure a beaker and a gram scale to make their pour over, and then sit on their patio at sunrise reading the latest medical research in the Journal of the American Medical Association. But I wasn’t one of those.
In my third year of medical school, the year that I began my clinical rotations, I started a different narrative for myself. I began to pride myself on being more well-rounded than the kids whose identity rested on being a future physician. On occasion, I would slip away to parties filled with graduate business students from the nearby university and not- so- slyly signal that although I was soon to be a physician, I was more than that. I would chat about the latest Desperate Housewives episode, fling my hair like Beyonce while dancing to Crazy In Love, and never mention that I had spent the whole day reading about how the kidney regulates plasma osmolarity. When specifically asked what I did, I didn’t lie like my friend, Molly. I just didn’t volunteer the information. Molly would say that she worked at Express. She said that guys were no longer interested in her when she mentioned that she was in medical school. I found that to be ridiculous. I would never hide who I was for a man. Even now a full decade later, after spending an entire evening talking to a man and failing to mention what I do, it isn’t for him.
“Yes, it says My Deepest Sympathies,” she responded, her weathered hand passing me the four by two-inch paper that accompanied the basket of white flowers. I always found it fascinating that lilies are believed to represent rebirth and purity, yet are often found at funerals. Such opposition within one flower. “Okay, great. Can I also borrow a pen?” I asked. I wasn’t prepared for today in more ways than one.
I remember the day that Rebecca walked into my office for her New OB appointment. The first appointment that a patient has after a pregnancy has been confirmed. Nothing was particularly remarkable about Rebecca or her past medical history. She was a humbly pretty mother of one who had previously delivered via cesarean section for failure to progress. She had an iridescent glow despite wearing little make up. Her natural beauty was enhanced by the first trimester hormones and her cheeks shined as they pressed up under her eyes beaming with excitement. “Hi, I am Rebecca and this is Lincoln,” she announced while motioning to her first born. Rebecca’s humility left a wide-open stage for her son to shine, and that he did. The minute this little boy opened his mouth I was enamored. He spoke with language way beyond his years, stretching multi-syllable words into song with his six year- old bird like voice. He excitedly watched as his mother’s blood was drawn, questioning the phlebotomist about her technique like he was being tested on the material later that afternoon. His wide eyes, round face and inquisitive nature made him seem more like a cartoon of a child than an actual one. The cartoons that look like they are for kids, but are written for adults.
Over the next twenty-six weeks, I would speak more and more with Lincoln during his mother’s visits. He would ask me questions and I would gladly answer. I showed him my stethoscope and let him listen to my heart on the days his mother was getting her ultrasounds and he would giggle with overwhelming joy shouting “I heard it! I heard it!” I loved the days that he came to the office and his mother told me that he loved coming also.
I had always kept a definitive line between my personal and professional life. I had colleagues that would befriend their patients. Nothing inappropriate, but enough closeness that after the delivery they would friend them on Facebook or accept an invite to dinner. Not me. I liked the dichotomy of me. I liked living on the other side of town- not to run into any patients while shopping. I liked having no social media footprint. I liked that none of my patients knew anything about my personal life. “I am only a doctor until five-o-clock,” I would joke to my friends, who were mostly in the entertainment industry. As an OB-GYN I was so often on call that the statement was false, but the sentiment was true. All these years I had successfully kept the different parts of me separate.
Rebecca’s pregnancy and repeat cesarean of her second child was uncomplicated. Her postpartum stay was routine. It wasn’t any different than most of my patient encounters and I would have forgotten it entirely if it hadn’t been accompanied with watching Lincoln bask in the glory of becoming a sibling. Yes, he was wearing the obligatory “I am a Big Brother” T-shirt, but it was the nature in which he inspected his baby sister, Lenny’s toes and then fingers like an explorer discovering life on another planet, that left his mark on me. Three days later as I punched in Rebecca’s discharge order into the hospital computer system, I felt a pang of sadness. Yes, there would be two more office visits. One for an incision check and one at six weeks for a complete postpartum examination, but overall, I would be seeing Lincoln less. So, one year later when I received the invite for Lenny’s first birthday party I chose to do something I hadn’t done before and RSVP’d “yes.”
The day of the party, I parked my car down the street from Rebecca’s house in West LA. It was a three- bedroom, modest looking English country style home that was built in the 1920’s. If it were in Iowa it would have cost roughly three-hundred thousand dollars, but in the middle of Santa Monica it was upwards of three million. I nervously walked up to the door like it was the first day of ninth grade and I had just transferred to a new school. I fiddled with my dress, gripped my gift bag with my right hand and started to knock with my left when Lincoln flung open the door, “Dr. Kloss! Please enter, welcome, come on in, you can leave your purse in the foyer.” I smirked at his seven going on forty-seven style greeting and all of my anxiety dissipated. ‘This is fine,’ I thought to myself. No harm, no foul. Doctors used to do house calls all the time and although this wasn’t a house call, it was a house visit.
During the party, I mainly hung out in the back of the yard, keeping to myself. I was hoping to spend time with Lincoln, but he was busy flapping his arms screaming “Marco!” with his friends in the pool. I gladly ate sugary, grocery-store vanilla cake with hot-pink frosting, was publicly honored by Rebecca and her husband, Tanner, as the doctor that delivered Lenny, and shortly after excused myself to get back to my other life. I was meeting my girlfriends at The Troubadour later that night for the first ever Guns N’ Roses reunion show. As I was back in the foyer picking up my black leather cross-body bag, Rebecca tip-toed behind me and gently tapped me on my shoulder. “Thank you for inviting me Rebecca, I have to go, I have some patient charts to catch-up on.” She warmly hugged me and whispered into my ear, “I am pregnant. See you in a couple of weeks.” I formally hugged her back and smiled with happiness for her, and for myself. 
I stared into the florist’s turquoise eyes as she passed me the pen, now realizing that she was quite beautiful. She didn’t need to iron out her forehead wrinkles with botulinum toxin just because everyone else in town did. “Is that all?” she asked. “Yes, thanks,” I replied. I decided to let the pre-printed front of the card send the message and I awkwardly scribbled “Sincerely, Dr. Kloss” in my hospital handwriting on the inside, put the pen down and headed out the door with my bouquet.
The first few months of Rebecca’s third pregnancy had the nostalgia of a high school reunion. Lincoln was back, but he was a bit older. He was verbose, but the almost two years that had passed since we first met had aged him just enough to remove some of his naïve enthusiasm. His baby sister was also along for these visits and he dutifully spent most of his time playing with her. I still enjoyed the days they visited, but I found my interest turning more towards Rebecca. I was interested in all of my patients; their past surgeries, family medical histories, and journeys to pregnancy, but I became more and more interested in Rebecca as a person. Who was this woman that had raised such an interesting child? Through talking with her, I learned that her and Tanner had met their junior year in college at UCLA. She was originally from Austin, Texas and her un-styled ponytail and minimal make up was not because she was too busy as a mom to fiddle with cosmetics, but because she was a hippie at heart. Like me, she had also spent many years buried in books. She was on her way to complete her PhD in Clinical Psychology when she became pregnant and because Tanner travelled quite often as the VP of Sales for a solar technology company, she decided to put her degree on pause to spend time with Lincoln. Her parents were back in Texas, where her sister also lived, and Tanner’s had passed away many years ago, leaving them the home that I had reluctantly visited. I think Rebecca began to enjoy her visits as much as I did because she started scheduling her appointments at 4:15 pm, my last appointment time of the day. She would stay in my office after her appointment ended asking a few pregnancy related questions, although we were both aware that she knew the answers, being that it was her third time around. Quickly our conversation flowed from pregnancy pains into our favorite recipe for nut-free pesto (we were both allergic), our favorite bingeable tv shows; mine was Younger and hers was The Crown, and the best spots for authentic wet burritos on the westside. One late afternoon, before she left the office out the back door that stayed unlocked after hours, I gave her my personal cell phone number and I saved hers in my phone. I told myself that I just wanted to make sure that I didn’t miss the delivery. When I saw her number light up across my phone screen just two weeks later when she was twenty-two weeks and two days pregnant, I smiled to myself, assuming she had come up with another reason to chat.
“Dr. Kloss?”
“Yes, Rebecca, What’s going on?”
“I think I broke my water.”
My heart dropped into my stomach. “Go to the hospital. I will meet you there and we will check you out and see what is going on.” I casually instructed her, covering my fear with programmed dialogue. 
I had entered the automatic doors that read “Labor and Delivery/Sala de Partos” more times than I had entered the front door of anywhere that I have lived, but when I passed through them to meet Rebecca on the other side I was hit with a mix of sorrow and angst that I had not felt before. What I had feared, was happening. Rebecca had broken her water. She had also started feeling contractions on her drive into the hospital. On her arrival, the nurse placed two external monitors around her abdomen, one for the baby’s heartbeat and one, a tocometer, to measure contractions. She was now contracting every five minutes and was moaning in anguish with every peak visualized on the screen. The baby’s heartbeat was elevated. I examined her and found her to be three centimeters dilated. She had a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit. There was no way to stop the labor and I had to not only explain to Rebecca that she had an infection and needed to be treated with antibiotics in order for the infection not to spread to her entire body and put her at risk of ending up very sick and in the ICU, or worse, but that the baby was going to be born and he was too early to survive or to try and save.  
She was still processing what I had told her when her baby was born.
His thinly-skinned, almost translucent body rested against my left forearm as I used my right hand to clamp and cut his umbilical cord. I everted my eyes from his chest refusing to see the signs of life that were present. Using physical pain as a diversion from the emotional pain that was increasing in pressure behind my eyes, I bit down on my tongue. I carefully wrapped her baby in a blue hospital towel and lifted him up to her. Tanner leaned over Rebecca holding her as she held their son and the both of them wept looking onto his fused eyelids that were too immature to look back. “I am so sorry.” I whispered, bowing my head. As I exited the room, I looked back at three of them to honor the moment as they embraced their baby and he left this world.   
My clammy hands gripped the flower basket as it stamped indentions into my palms. I should have written more on the card. “Who just signs their name?” I asked myself. “Should I have even come?” I questioned, but how could I say ‘yes’ to a birthday and ‘no’ to a funeral? Suddenly sorrow burst through my eyes knocking down a well-built wall. As I crept towards the funeral home doors, I began to weep, not just for Rebecca, but for all of the mothers that I had seen lose a baby. For all of the mothers that had a baby in the NICU. For all of the mothers that had bled too much or had experienced an unexpected C-section. The mothers with postpartum depression. The mothers without family support. The mothers that have endured abuse during pregnancy. The mothers without homes to take their babies to. I wasn’t different than other doctors. I wasn’t more fun. I wasn’t two different people. I had simply been compartmentalizing my grief away. I had been shutting it off, but today I couldn’t manage to find the power button.
A woman in a black pant suit and side-swept bun stood at the funeral home door. She had a classically pointed nose and the corners of her mouth turned up the same as Rebecca’s. Their likeness revealed that this was her sister. Sniffling quickly to try and stop the dripping from my nose, I unsteadily approached her. My hands shaking, I pushed the basket of flowers towards hers. She grasped the bouquet and our wet eyes met. My voice arose from my gut, climbed through my chest and out of my already open mouth,
 “Hello, I am Lily. I’m a friend of Rebecca’s.”  
 This letter isn’t to you, the band. This letter is for the band’s front man.
My apologies. Let’s start over.
Dear Chris Martin,
I love you. But we need to break up.
You don’t know me, Chris. We’ve never met. You grazed my hands at a concert once, but I’m told that doesn’t count. But you and I have history, my dear; decades of triumph, grief, adoration, frustration knotted and woven together in indecipherable patterns. I’ve discovered, in recent contemplations about our relations, it’s nearly impossible to unravel.
This letter is a risk. I’m sharing it regardless. So here we go, Chris Martin. I’m laying it all out like an atlas.
At this point [if you’ve even read to this point] you’re probably wondering about Drew. Who’s Drew? My husband. Yes, I’m married, but don’t worry. Drew knows about you. He’s not necessarily cool with you, but you won’t get in trouble for this. I will.
It’s just once, at your concert–a long time ago–you gyrated on a piano bench, and, well, what can you expect? And this was during my first date with Drew.
Way to make it complicated, Chris.
But I knew you way before Drew. I loved you before Drew, too. I discovered Coldplay when a friend suggested I “check out this hot, new band,” and loaned a CD. Oh, I checked it out, alright. On repeat. Waiting for a boyfriend to help with my flat tire on a busy interstate. The boyfriend never showed up. You don’t know this [because you weren’t there], but you and I got to know each other in that silver Taurus. I learned your words, your rhythms of speech. You sang to me in a voice congested, yet melodic. When I tried to call the boyfriend again, you sent a shiver. I nodded, wiped tears, contacted a state trooper instead. Despite not knowing what you looked like, we gained a level of intimacy in that moment.
I remember in magnificent detail the first time I matched your voice to the physical specimen. In college, I studied in a buried, wood-paneled bar several miles off campus. The place had a musty smell; everything inside was pliable and damp. The square windows, which let in no light, rattled violently whenever a train passed. I also frequented the bar because I liked the bartender. He was tall and thin, with long, graceful fingers that he used to pull back his blonde hair. Whenever he did this, I'd catch a glimpse of the four-star tattoo on his forearm. During downtime, which there was much of, he’d crane over the stocks page in a passenger's left-behind tribune. I went there once a week. He never noticed me. But you did, Chris Martin.
From the bar's dismal corner TV, I heard familiar chords and tuned in. I recognized your voice from a scary highway. I remembered crying in a Taurus as a gale of traffic blew by. I recalled the moment your voice held my hand and patted my knee until a state trooper arrived. It had been some time since; I didn’t realize you blossomed into a music video career. Our eyes locked through the bar’s dusty screen. You walked along a turbulent lakeshore in slow motion and never took your eyes off me. You crooned of skin and bones; you promised something beautiful.
I dropped my textbook.
You claimed to love me so.
The book fell loudly to the floor.
Told me to look at the stars. They shone for me. You said it.
I didn’t pick the book back up.
I’ve shared this moment with Drew. Several times. The last recount, he folded hands and sighed, “Please stop talking about Chris Martin.” I also told a student of mine about this moment. In my defense, I had to! Next to my desk in the classroom, I pinned the February 2016 Rolling Stone magazine cover where you’re propped on an elbow in a field of flowers, gazing dreamily. Sometimes — especially after a hard day — I’d rest on my elbow. Cradle my head. Gaze back.
The student tip-toed in after school to ask about homework and caught me doing this. In a rapid flurry, I bumbled how your voice felt like a barometric drop, how your eyes, the color of sky and metal, guided me at a dirty tavern. The student began to tip-toe out. I waved them back and described the train station bar from college. How our eyes locked on a temperamental lakeshore (through a television screen, of course).
Don’t fear, Chris Martin. I possess no stalker tendencies. Drew’s not even worried. Like I said, he knows about you. Ok…he worried once. I asked him to wrap his fingers in rainbow tape, toss color bombs upon arrival, and speak in a British accent. He said no.
I did behave on my first date with Drew, which, if you remember, was your concert. We met while you performed at an outdoor venue, aglow in dense Spring air. A steep grassy hill, damp from morning rain, sucked at our soles. Red and blue lights oscillated. Drew and I made eye contact. We smiled. Nodded. He made me giggle. I moved in closer. That night, the world disappeared, and I’m sorry Chris, so did you. While you head-banged a piano, Drew hooked my pinky with his, looked down and mouthed, “Can this be our first date?” I nodded up at him.
I didn’t tell Drew about you right away. In those early days of starting my life with him, you’d pop into town here and there. I’d still come see you perform. It was at one of those concerts I finally confessed our relationship. Well, confess might not be the right word. Drew discovered us. It’s your fault. First of all, you grazed my hands. I had to scream. Secondly, you had been working out. I saw it when your t-shirt lifted in mid-air.
I clutched Drew, “Those abs,” I gasped, “like steel window panes.”
“Who me?” Drew looked around bewildered.
“No. Chris Martin.” I turned to the man standing behind us and repeated my anatomical observation to seek agreement. The man stared. Pulled his kid in close. So I said to the kid, about thirteen, “Don’t you see? Those pecs… sturdy thighs…and eyes…like blue humidity.” Drew tugged hard at my sleeve. Later, my husband suggested I apologize to the father. I did. But Drew wasn’t mad at me. How could he be? It was harmless flirtation back then, Chris. You’d spring up, wave some glow sticks around, maybe give a little ab peek. I’d squeal, and you’d leave.
You and I didn’t get intimate again for a long time. Years, actually. I already had a teaching career I never wanted to leave. Drew and I already lived in our forever-home on a street lined with one-hundred-year-old trees. I hadn’t, in my life, experienced any real tragedy. Until our child passed away.
Drew doesn’t know this, Chris. In the months following my son’s death (with insomnia as a side effect of grief), I’d sneak out of bed in the middle of the night and watch your music videos. I started with the first video, the one where you’re walking along a lake. You were so young in that video. So foolish. Trudging that volatile shore in a light jacket. Your slapped red cheeks and defensive blinks told me you knew you were ill prepared. But you weathered it, Chris. In slow motion. And you never broke your gaze away from the camera. Away from me.
Wrapped in a knitted blanket, illuminated by the glow of a screen, I’d watch your other music videos for hours. But I always ended with the video that played in reverse. In this video, you’re a little older and appropriately dressed for the environment. You still moved in slow motion, and never broke your gaze from me. But you had to walk backwards through tunnels, bridges, and concrete. To the scene of the accident. The point of collision. You warned that no one said it would be easy. But nothing foretold it would be this hard. You and I both begged to go back to the start.
The song is The Scientist.
I told a woman at an Arizona truck stop about that song. I described how I snuck past security guards at a concert to be closer to you. No, not like stalker-close. Not those kinds of guards. I mean slipping past ticket attendants to exchange nosebleeds for the floor. I told the Arizona woman how Drew and I slithered through bodies in the rain. I told her how I held his hand and sang the lyrics. I didn’t tell her about you, Chris Martin. You were not part of that moment. Only me and Drew, spinning and spinning under a butane sky lit orange and blue.
After that concert, I felt more comfortable telling Drew about you [until he asked I stop describing your biceps and athletic agility]. This may hurt your feelings, but you became a marital joke between us. Like when the ‘conscious uncoupling’ thing happened — sorry, by the way — I’d tease that I was going to uncouple him and marry you. Drew would respond, “Ok, as long as I can be Chris Martin’s roadie.”
Drew doesn’t know this next part, though. In the wake of the pandemic, Drew sat me down at a table and said, “We are moving.” He has no idea you became involved with putting my forever home on the market and writing my letter of resignation. I sobbed after cleaning out my classroom. Then I couldn’t get out of bed. For three full days.
Insomnia can happen twice because of grief. So after the third day, you and I, Chris, began hooking up again. Nightly. While everyone slept, I’d creep out of the house, hand-lift the garage door, climb in my Jeep, put it in neutral, lights off, and allow gravity to pull me down to the street. In the middle of the night, I’d turn the ignition and leave.
Traveling interstates, choosing random exits, weaving through town streets until civilization emptied, I drove until I became lost. I’d pull onto earth, park amidst wind-whipped grasses, lay on the car's hood and stare at a sky full of Bic confetti. I always located the Little Dipper first. Its handle is easiest to see…four stars aligned perfectly. You don’t know this, Chris, but you and I became intimate again on the hood of that Jeep. Such history between us, I no longer needed to see your eyes on me or rewind a music video. Things changed. We discovered a deep, deep intimacy.
I only needed to feel your lyrics.
Sometimes I’d smoke, despite quitting two decades ago. I’d almost always weep. Sometimes I played your old CD, the one from a broken-down Taurus on an interstate. I’d think about how young and foolish we were. At that bar. At that lake. Wrapped in a blanket. I’d think of the experiences we shared [if you don’t remember them, it’s because you were never there].
I’d count how much was stolen in the wake of the pandemic.
During the weeks we prepared to move, I played a new song on repeat, the one where you promise to try and fix me. On those midnight rendezvous, no matter the climate, I’d open the Jeep’s windows and allow tears to stream down my face. I didn’t need to see you walking in slow motion anymore or being pummeled by a lake. Your words alone captured what it was like to lose something that can’t be replaced. You vowed lights would guide me home, so I’d whisper, “Ok Chris, take me.”
Then I’d twist my hair back, turn the ignition, and find my way back in reverse, traversing dirt roads, side streets, bridges, and highways. It didn’t matter the open patch of earth I chose to leave. Roads connected, intertwined, braided together intimately. Sometimes it took hours to unweave, but every time I made it home and pulled into the garage, headlights off, silent.
Then I’d crawl under the covers, hold my breath and wait. Because Drew always rolled over and put his arms around my waist. I’d nuzzle close. Exhale. Breathe.
When I couldn’t get out of bed after cleaning out the classroom I thought I’d never leave, Drew did the same thing, only he climbed in next to me. I didn’t expect that one to level me.
But it did. Like an 8.7 earthquake. After the violent rattling, I learned something about you in that moment, and something about that lake. We need to return to that brutal shore and stare eye to eye again. I was naive. I didn’t know any better back then. I needed to cut through the wind, wipe the mist from my eyes, and really see. I never needed you, Chris Martin. Not once. Those places we traversed were mere satellites of my own center of gravity. I was born and bred on that land; I understand every lakeshore, violet hill, and midnight sky intuitively. Those roads, those paths, even the interstate, guide me without you singing.
So good-bye, Chris Martin.
Hugo told me once that fall was his favorite time of the year. Told me to hold leaves as delicate as you would a pretty girl’s hand. His teeth would then spread wide across his face. Pallid and flaked with brown. Rows of sweet tooth that hadn’t been cleared of duff. 
On his days off we’d go hunting for mushrooms in the forest behind our house. “It’s hard to tell which mushrooms are edible,” Hugo would say. Always said, giddy over the possibility of the inedible as he led me through the forest. My studies turned to what you can eat. It didn't matter if it were safe or not.
That day, Hugo pulled me along— his meaty fingers pressed white hot divots into my skin. I followed as quickly as I could, but Hugo was excited, alcohol and smoke wafting off him in ribbons. My shoes filled with filth. 
Mycology was his most recent hobby. An acquisition from an old friend he said.
Hugo's hobbies often skipped from one gruesome hobby to another. From taxidermy to collecting dead things in jars; these activities though innocuous in some hands, turned sinister in his. A field mouse captured in our backyard was less a friend and more an exercise in how long he could extend its suffering, how well he could preserve those little moments of despair, driving a needle in, then capturing the moment in frame by frame photographs. To pinpoint the exact moment, the most miniscule of details. Measured them in the span of flesh stretched to its limit, twisted in abject horror. It was a different kind of science. One that I likened to a kind of dark magic; powerful and detrimental to its user and the people around him. Wrapped up like something beautiful and awful, sequined and glittering, but dripping in oil slick, rainbow sheets of sludge.
Hugo yanked me forward, grip turning tighter. I tripped and he laughed, still dragging me along over root and rock until we hit a clearing with one solitary tree sitting in its center. Its trunk was devoid of a small swath of bark, smooth even at a distance. 
As we got closer, I saw a ring of mushrooms at its base that traveled up its trunk in a spiral pattern. Up and up it disappeared into its canopy. 
“Oyster mushrooms,” he said, releasing my hand to pluck one from the bark. He left marks. My reddened wrist contrasted against the pale white of freshly pulled bark. It reminded me of his angry red gums gnashing at me, smiles and frowns. Hugo was smiling at me then, pulling swiftly and roughly, tearing off just as much bark as he was mushrooms, raining clumps of brown to join the clutter of the forest floor.
Bark and mush fell haphazard atop a corpse—a fox—carpeted in what looked like to be more mushrooms. They bisected its torso. The mound of mushrooms, which looked like nothing I'd ever seen in Hugo's many, many books, stemmed like a dress from its waist, draping the rest of its body in its fungal carpet. Only its feet were left uncovered. But they were not bare, frost had started its seasonal creep, transforming the Foxes’ paws into glass slippers. Winter’s supine approach had begun, starting with her. I hadn’t realized it when we first arrived. This was a birthplace; a death, anchoring itself to the forest. 
I continued to stare at the fox, searching. Her light-less eyes glittered at me in the dying light. Resurrected under my attention; life found unraveled, unspun at my feet, thread loose and fibers imbued with story. I imagined that she smiled a smile at me full of sharp, friendly teeth. For the briefest of moments I felt the whisper of her touch—her paw caressing my cheek, and telling me how this fate had befell her. A story not too dissimilar from mine. I had to protect her.
I knew what Hugo would do to her if he found her. Exactly the way he’d extricate her and preserve her, perpetually dead in his basement with a sprinkling of mushrooms and fall leaves for company. The other dead animals didn’t count. They had no more half lives; no in-between. That was my domain. With liminal fingers half crusted with frost, straining from the breakdown of cartilage, that life would wrap around the soft bend of my joints, her joints. She’d sit taut and stiff, halfway between specimen and taxidermy, a product of clumsy hands and even clumsier mouths, cruelly propped up against the door to let the draft in. We weren’t meant to be gutted and set for display.
Hugo’s delighted face was sharp; shadows fell across him like they belonged there, deepening the crags and dips of his smile.
The fox’s unseeing eyes still bore into mine, and as Hugo stepped back from his rough foraging to look at me, I blocked the fox from view with my body, leaning languid against the tree.
His eyes raked over me, hungry open maws of sight. He made to move toward me, his basket overflowing with an abundance of mushrooms dangling from his elbow. I did not flinch. I had been chewed up and spat out before. But a single oyster tumbled out of the basket, falling at his feet. His eyes darted down. Curses tumbled from his lips just as the mushroom just had. He crouched and picked up the singular mushroom, angrily brushing the excess dirt off it. He looked so vulnerable there, on his knees, cooing over the fallen thing as though he hadn’t just violently torn it from its home moments before.
A rock sat right by the foxes' head, large enough to serve as its stony pillow, jagged enough that it could promise a painful and messy death. Her dead eyes smiled at me; her form less vulpine and more human the longer I stared at that rock and breathed life into her story. If the fox had hands and strength enough to lift it, would it have lived? Would her paws not be dipped in ice? Would she be here now, acting as my hands? My hands had already found their way to the rock, having leaned down as I had pondered those questions. I inched closer to Hugo, staring at the top of his head. I examined his receding hairline and the numerous nascent liver spots and silver hairs—it looked like pencil lines interrupted by a filthy and worn down eraser.
His eyes met mine then. I don’t know how he didn’t notice until I was already towering over him, rock gripped in both my hands, raised over my head. His eyes bore into me. Terribly blue eyes as death clung to me, whispering to me, “I’d never get them out of my hair—the leaves—the mushrooms—not until…. “
She sat at my shoulder, right there inside the memory of our house sitting quietly without him. A vision tailor made for me. Her tails unfurled; her teeth sharpened. Her gown of mushrooms was apparent and as white as the snow, taking on the quality of shaggy fur. Delicate like the tendrils of a medusa, she was a woman sitting on our porch. She was a fox sitting on my porch, her ears tipped with frost and twitching as leaves fell from our maple tree, never falling outside of the careful circle that we laid out for him. 
What would I do without him? she asked. 
Maybe spend that fall studying the weight of the leaves and measure them in the fade of green to withered brown. Gather them in piles, feel how they’d crumble to pieces in my hand—the crunch of their skeletons, soft and grainy in their collapse. 
Decomposition will sit with you. Set in the circumstance of life. Circles of death and rot. The house will sit empty, but they will sit quietly. No hands to interrupt.
My hands shook imagining the collapse; she shook, shedding the gown of mushrooms, taking on the look of death in its entirety and encouraging me to lift.
And so I did. As I raised the stone higher, I watched his eyes drown with a surety. A certainty. Realization. Recognition. She comes for us all at some point; clever little foxes that don’t stay dead. But for now she wasn’t here for me.  All she did was help guide my hand. 
The oyster mushroom he had cleaned of dirt sat snug in his hand. I could see it waiting; the knowing of what was to come and the knowing that it would not change anything for it and its brethren. But Hugo and his eyes, those terribly blue eyes did not care. He smashed it in his fist, letting its flesh ooze out between his fingers. And for the second time that day he showed me that sweet tooth smile, wide and menacing. 
I swung down.
“Stop daydreaming Mr. Delano.”
In a moment, Mrs. Frampton, subjecting the tender wallflower of my affection to the grotesque spotlight of her own indifference, made cease the contemplation of my life’s own end, the one theme of my existence: Andrea Taylor.
It’s the Spring of 2005; I am a 7th grader at Fort Sumter Middle School, home of the Trojans. Andrea sits enthroned one row ahead, three columns to my right. I have mixed feelings about this, for while it affords me an almost uninterrupted view of her during second and fifth period, it also places her immediately adjacent to Kyle Schwimmer: another seventh grader, possessed of summit-less bicep peaks, which forces me to a fixed conclusion that he’s been injecting steroids intravenously since infancy, and whose hair, defying no less than two laws of thermodynamics, I am sure, manages to appear wet and shiny hours after we all have a just expectation that it should be dry. I despise Kyle Schwimmer.
Andrea herself, ah! Andrea, crowned with brown tresses, and bangs; layered alternately and Kevlar-like in Abercrombie and Hollister tank tops; floating on a cloud of all-white Etnies; and tastefully adorned in torn and acid-washed denim: if Helen, Esther, Cleopatra, Meghan Fox herself stood before me, they could, collectively, aspire to light but a Yankee-candle of affection before the blast furnace that is my love for Andrea Taylor.
She dignifies all she touches. Braces, hitherto unthinkable, become the obvious conclusion of several months’ jagged back-and-forth between myself and my mother: she, keenly impressed by the delayed gratification of orthodontics; I, unwilling to suffer an infinite two years of public degradation before my muse. That is, until Andrea arrives one Monday morning, her teeth elegantly arrayed in alternating pink and key-lime green squares – her two favorite colors, and now mine. At best, she freely elected the ornamentation and the entire school, nay the entire world, must soon follow suit. At worst, she was compelled by her parents, and to join her was now a question of solemn solidarity.
“I said stop daydreaming Mr. Delano! You’re not even on the right page! You had better snap out of it before this evening. And to think, you before the entire school!”
As the sole member of my 7th grade class to make the Principal’s List for four quarters consecutively, I was nominated by the Student council, that reverend body, to deliver the customary student-speech at the Spring awards banquet. My entire family would be present, as would a large portion of the student body, their own families included. My speech was already prepared some week in advance, but the grandeur of the event – the achievement of garishly mismatched ties and dress shirts of which adolescent boys seem uniquely capable; the attendance of one’s forebears; the event’s occurring at night! – all of this called for something more than a bare statement of the facts, a weak-kneed acknowledgement of one’s faculty and peers; it demanded romance. 
Everything had prepared me for this moment: by which I mean chiefly Disney channel movies, but it feels like everything. I must take the occasion to declare my intentions, my love for Andrea. I set to work. 
Let it not be supposed that the account I now relate is unrealistic, for I am convinced that if the same series of events does not unfold hourly at middle schools across the country, it is to be attributed less to any want of imagination or romantic inclination on the part of adolescent boys, and more to their own diffidence in making such feelings known. My case may be singular in that I did declare my love, but then, mine was no common love. 
The night arrives. I scramble numbly from the third row of my mother’s van just in time to witness Kyle Schwimmer emerging from the passenger seat of his older brother’s Mazda Miata, a convertible. A pox on all his house! I’m wearing a light-blue button-down, hastily-ironed khakis, and, in defiance of all my mother’s objections, a striped tie: green and pink. Kyle is in all black. I think this is ridiculous. I take a second look. It doesn’t seem quite so ridiculous. I wonder why I did not wear all black. I hate Kyle Schwimmer.
We begin to walk past what should be familiar sights, but in the dark, and on a night of such moment, I recognize nothing. That is… until I hear her voice. Andrea and her parents are following just feet behind us. My younger brother trips over a step. I despise him with my entire soul. She doesn’t seem to notice, or to impute his failings to me despite our near relation. I hold the door open. My mother thanks me with a half-tone of surprise which, I trust, instantly exposes my sham gallantry for what it is. I cannot escape the suspicion that in the short time it took us to move from the van into the school, I have fallen, like one of Milton’s angels, to the furthest recesses of the pit in Andrea’s esteem. She smiles as she enters through the door – I am confident that no door has ever been restrained by such a superfluity of force – and is heard to say, “Hi John!” I ascend all at once from Inferno to Purgatorio to Paradiso. I respond in monosyllables - though, apparently, to some effect, as she graces me with a smile and proceeds accompanied to the cafeteria-made-banquet-hall.
She wears a strapless white dress with black polka dots - I wish she wouldn’t bare her shoulders, what if Kyle Schwimmer sees? - black flats, a red handbag, and a puzzling mix of blush and eye-shadow, the effect of which might have proven comical to an elder member of her own sex, but which appeared to me the very incarnation of beauty.
A half hour passes during which I’m ushered to a seat onstage by Mrs. Frampton, the cafeteria grows steadily more full, and my bowels become a butterfly house. Finally, it is my turn to speak. I address my peers, their parents, our faculty and administration, make some general remarks about the progress of the year. In short, I read the entirety of my two-minute speech which had passed successively beneath the careful scrutiny first of my father, then of Mrs. Frampton, then of the assistant principal. But I am not done. Unfolding from my shirt pocket another sheet of college-ruled paper, scrutinized by none but myself, I begin. 
I am catatonic. The few claps which do follow serve only to foreground the vacuum I’ve made of this middle school cafeteria. I’m shushed down the steps by Mrs. Frampton to the empty seat between my father and younger brother. The assistant principal clears his throat and continues as though I’d never said a word. I don’t dare meet my mother’s eyes. Shuffling ensues as the guests are released to the buffet table. My parents think it best that we excuse ourselves. The sole glimpse I catch of Andrea is of her staring directly down, neither white nor red, but somehow both, entirely, simultaneously – with a parent’s hand on each of her shoulders.
We drive home in silence – at least as far as dialogue goes: the radio insists on playing, and I wonder why every single song seems a mockery of the events of the last hour. 
It would be true to say that I spend the evening in agony. It would be equally true to say that I was very nearly buoyant. It was like one of my track meets: an agonizing affair so long as it continued, and even immediately after the race was run, but it just felt so good to have it over with.
I spend time in front of a book, though not quite reading; in front of my television, though not quite watching; and finally, I turn to the family computer. Dare I? She wouldn’t…? I log in to AOL Instant Messenger and there, carved in black pixels is AndreaaaT93. Petrified, mortified, ossified: like some antediluvian fish buried beneath the waves of judgment and become stone, I undergo internal decomposition in a moment. I move to log off when a window appears:
AndreaaaT93: I love you too. :)  
She moved to Colorado that summer; her father received orders to a new base. 
It’s the Spring of 2023. I’ve not seen her since. I’ve loved others, or at least said I did. Still I can’t help but wonder how much happier the world might be if we all married the first girl we fell in love with. Has my love ever since been so disinterested? I used to wish that a bear would burst into the halls of our school, so that I’d have something to behead, something to lay at her feet. I wanted to become a soldier, just so I could perish carrying a small portrait of her in my breast pocket. I plundered songs and movie scenes for lines to express, if only to myself, what I could not but feel. It was idolatrous, but, perhaps, not without meaning. Why was I so soon enthralled? Why, in 7th grade, looking for a dragon to slay, a princess to save? 
It will be observed that the contents of my panegyric have been excised from the narrative. The reader may rest assured that Andrea was wooed with all the accumulated prowess an eleven year old may be justly expected to muster. I invoked Shakespeare, Noah Webster; several verses of Stevie Nicks’ “Landslide” and more than one Coldplay song were flagrantly plagiarized; in short: I declared my love to her in no uncertain terms. Kyle Schwimmer teased me ferociously until the end of the year. But then, Kyle Schwimmer was never, if only for a brief moment, loved by Andrea Taylor.
Mitzee was in prison for a crime he did not commit.
Well, OK, he probably had committed it once or twice. Who knew? Who kept count? But he was very sure that he had been incarcerated now because of something he didn’t do. He glared through the prison bars, plotting. He was Houdini, Al Capone, and Einstein rolled into one. There was nothing he couldn’t do… except break out of this prison, apparently.
If looks could kill, there would be no one left alive in this joint. If he could get out, he’d make each and every one of them sorry they were born. So he sat and glared, the unblinking, one eyed glare that unnerved his enemies. No one stayed before his cell for long. They moved on quickly, repulsed by his battered visage and death ray glare from his single working eye.
He looked around at his fellow inmates. Some lay resigned to their fate, their eyes blank with despair, others shivered and cried, wailing at their fate with terror. The two brothers in the cell on the end of the opposite row cried in fear. They were barely legal, mere babes, and he wondered what was their heinous crime? What had they done to be sent here to maximum security? Perhaps they were framed.
Directly across from him was Snow. Butter wouldn’t melt in her mouth, and she reclined like a queen surveying her subjects. She knew how to work the system, all the guards bent to her will, as she slowly batted her lashes in their direction, purring her delight to see them again. She was a master at manipulation, that one. He’d met her more than once or twice on the outside, and they’d even had a thing going for a while. She looked sweet and innocent, but she was tough as nails. They had worked one joint together in the old days. She was sleek and fast, in and out with her purloined goods. He had been the scout that time, surveying the joint, ready to set off the alarm or create a distraction. Snow had shared the loot, she was an alright sort. Just don’t get on her bad side, or she’d cut you without remorse.
A smaller visitor stopped before his cell, eyes wide with an emotion Mitzee could not name. Horror? Fright? Disgust? Pick one. He gave the small visitor his best one eyed glare and accompanied it with a snarling growl. The visitor moved on, just as he liked it. He enjoyed being alone. He really did. Less to worry about, less to factor into a daily plan, and Mitzee had a plan. Bath, eat, glare. It worked for him. There was nothing else to do. He was on the countdown to death-row, and he knew it. Not much point worrying about it, not much point wailing. Bath, eat, glare. Right until the end.
Snow obviously had other plans. She simpered in her cell as the small visitor passed, flirting shamelessly. She was a chameleon, good at becoming what she needed to be to survive. Mitzee was just too old for it, it took too much energy, but good for her. Snow’s antics entranced the small visitor and she wound herself sinuously into convoluted dance steps that were designed to hypnotise and mesmerise the audience. Captive became captor, and soon Snow was free. God, she was good! From her small, transportable travel cell, she crowed triumphantly. Off to minimum security prison for her. Mitzee wondered how long it would be before Snow busted out. He reckoned she’d be back here within a month, but it was unlikely he’d still be here to see her. He sent her his best ‘well f*ck off and to hell with you’ glare. She smiled like a cat who got the cream. Good to know they still understood one another, he thought.
The prison guards came and went, his cell was cleaned on a regular rotation and the litter was removed and replaced. If he didn’t dream of freedom, of following the butcher bird in the early morning dawn and pitting his wits against the noisy little bugger, he’d be happy, or at least content. But freedom was as long gone as his eye. This was it for him, and he knew it.
He watched as each inmate got their reprieve, their chance at freedom that was precariously perched in the hands of unsuspecting visitors, victims if you will. But no one came for Mitzee.
“I’m unlovable,” he thought to himself with a kind of twisted pride. “I have a face that only a mother could love, and I never knew my mother.”
“Mommy, look, this kitty’s only got one eye!”
Mitzee opened said eye and glared at the little visitor. She wore a patch over her half her face, and the eye that was visible stared into his cell with interest. He hissed and glared, showing all his teeth. The little visitor’s mouth opened wide, showing him all her teeth too. Mitzee was impressed. Some teeth were missing. This little visitor was a scrapper. Must have fought many battles to be so scarred and toothless.
“I want this one.”
“Honey, don’t you think you should have a good look around? This one’s quite old, and he looks quite beat up!”
The little visitor turned her head to glare at the older one who spoke. Mitzee was at once amazed and enchanted. The glare was awe-inspiring, and it obviously came naturally to her.
“Well, if you’re sure. How about we ask the staff about him?”
Soon Mitzee found himself in a room he had never been in before, but had seen other inmates enter—the meet and greet room. It was strange to be in such wide open spaces again and he crept slowly, stomach low to the floor, poised and ready to leap out of harm’s way at any given second. The little visitor sat cross-legged in the middle of the floor and beckoned with treats and soft noises. Treats! Mitzee had never seen or smelled treats, and, against his better nature, he was intrigued.
“He likes me.”
“It would seem so,” the prison attendant said in amazement. “I’ve never seen old Mitzee cuddle up to anyone before. He’s usually the spitting, hissing kind of cat. We thought to re-home him as a barn cat. Are you sure you want this one?”
The little visitor looked Mitzee in the eye, single eye to single eye. “He’s just like me. He knows how to feel different from everyone else.”
“If that’s what you want to believe, little visitor, who am I to disagree?” Mitzee thought to himself, but outwardly he purred.
For the first time in his life, Mitzee was bundled into the transportable travel cell. This was his big moment, the one he never thought to have. He was off to minimum security. The little visitor babbled about a new home, a bed, food and toys. It all sounded so good, so warm and loving to Mitzee. He yowled a long, “Goodbye suckers!” to the inmates still incarcerated as he was bundled out through the doors, before being settled into the back seat of a car.
He yawned as he watched the scenery flash past, and already he was planning his big escape. His single eye twinkled with glee.
